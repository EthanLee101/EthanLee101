**`Computer Programmer (Full-time Computer Science Student @ UCLA)`**

I'm a software developer with a big passion for game development, AI, ML, and full-stack work. I love creating solutions that make a real difference, blending technology with meaningful impact. From brainstorming and design to hands-on coding, each project is a chance to challenge myself and bring unique ideas to life. I’m especially drawn to crafting immersive, user-centered experiences that people enjoy and find useful. Let’s connect at eplee24@g.ucla.edu or on LinkedIn—I'd love to collaborate and build something amazing together!
